### Decision Making

| 27 | 🥏 **Feedback Loop** | Feedback communicates results | Instant success/error states |
| 52 | 💫 **Feedforward** | Know what to expect before action | "This will take ~15 mins" |

### Trust & Retention
| # | Principle | Description | Application |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 41 | 🎁 **Reciprocity** | Give to receive | Free problems before paywall |
| 43 | 🏺 **Pseudo-Set Framing** | Grouped tasks tempting to complete | "3/5 problems in Sliding Window" |
